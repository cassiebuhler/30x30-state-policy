# README

This repository contains a curated dataset of U.S. state-level 30×30 policy implementation and progress.  
Policy records were collected, reviewed, and standardized by the author from publicly available primary sources, then compiled into a single, harmonized dataset.

State-level policy information is presented alongside U.S. Census state boundaries and visualized as maps to support comparison across states and policy mechanisms.

**Implementation Key**
- Executive Order: A formal, binding directive issued by a governor that establishes policy and directs agency action.
- Executive Commitment: A public commitment or policy declaration by a governor or senior executive official supporting 30×30 goals, without the legal force of an executive order.
- Statute: A law enacted by the state legislature and signed into law, providing statutory authority for implementation.
- Statute (Other): A statute that advances 30×30–related objectives without explicitly committing to 30×30.
- Legislative Resolution: A non-binding legislative action expressing intent or support, without enforceable requirements.
- Proposed Bill(s) — Legislation introduced but not enacted, indicating intent without legal effect.
